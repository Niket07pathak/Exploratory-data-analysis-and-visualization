# Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

**Notebook:** `Exploratory_data_analysis_and_visualization (1).ipynb`

This repository provides a clean walkthrough of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization steps used to understand a dataset, spot data‑quality issues, and surface actionable insights. It consolidates common EDA patterns—schema inspection, summary statistics, missing‑value analysis, correlations, and exploratory charts—into a single, reproducible workflow.

### Notebook Narrative (Auto‑extracted)
> Plotting two functions: 1. $y = cos(4x)$ 2. $y = cos(x)$ In the interval: $[-\pi, +\pi]$

> Performing some basic EDA (exploratory data analysis) on some Divvy trip data The variables in this data frame are defined as: - `ride_id`: Index of ride -- uniquely identifies each ride - `rideable_type`: Type of bike used for ride (`electric_bike`/`classic_bike`/`docked_bike`) - `started_at`: Date and time at the start of the ride - `ended_at` : Date and time at the end of the ride -...

> Plotting the total number of rides vs. the start date.

> Useing seaborn's `barplot` function to make a bar chart showing the average number of rides **started** by `member`s in the: 1. Morning (5:00 AM - 11:59 AM) 2. Afternoon (12:00 PM - 04:59 PM) 3. Evening (5:00 PM - 8:59 PM) 4. Night (9:00 PM - 4:59 AM)

> The afternoon has the highest average number of rides, whereas the night has the lowest average number of rides. The amount of sunlight can be a plausible cause of this trend; more members may prefer riding during bright daylight. Another possible reason could be safety; biking during the daytime can be safer compared to riding at night.

> Using`seaborn` to make side-by-side boxplots of total `electric_bike`, `classic_bike`, and `docked_bike` rides **started** on any given day in the dataframe.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Common data/plotting libraries detected from code:
  - warnings
warnings (2), pandas (1), matplotlib (1), google (1)

## 📦 Data

The notebook expects a tabular dataset (CSV or similar). Detected data sources:

- `/content/Jan 25-Feb 8, 2021 - Core Trends Survey - CSV.csv`
- `divvy_data.csv`

If your data lives elsewhere, adjust the path(s) in the corresponding `pd.read_csv(...)` (or loader) cells.

## 🔎 What This Notebook Does

The EDA workflow (auto‑detected from code) includes:
- Summary statistics via `.describe()`
- Schema/nullable check via `.info()`
- Top records previews with `.head()`
- Categorical distribution via `.value_counts()`
- Aggregations with `.groupby()`
- Outlier checks (quantiles/IQR/boxplots)
- Plots with Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly

Key columns referenced in the code (top‑frequency): `started_at`, `intfreq`, `member_casual`, `income_map`, `Frequency`, `Percentage`, `Total`, `age`, `Value`, `educ2`, `ended_at`, `start_date`.



## 🖼️ Visualizations

Typical plots may include distributions (histograms/kde), category counts (bar charts), relationships (scatter/line), and correlation heatmaps. Re‑run the notebook cells to regenerate figures for your data snapshot.

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. **Create environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -U pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # (Optional) If you add one
   ```

2. **Install common EDA libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
   # Add: scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels if needed
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter and open the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Exploratory_data_analysis_and_visualization (1).ipynb"
   ```

4. **Point to your dataset** by editing the loader cell(s) and run all cells.

## ✅ Tips for Reproducibility

- Set a `random_state` for any sampling/modeling steps.
- Keep a `requirements.txt` by exporting your environment:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
- If figures are important to your report, save them to a `figures/` folder:
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.savefig("figures/your_plot.png", bbox_inches="tight", dpi=150)
  ```

## 📊 Suggested Extensions

- Add a **data dictionary** table summarizing each feature (type, missing %, cardinality).
- Produce an **automated profiling** report (e.g., `ydata-profiling`, `sweetviz`) for a quick baseline.
- Try **feature importance** with a simple tree‑based model to surface informative columns.
- Track results over time by saving **notebook outputs** and **figures** with timestamps.

## 🔒 Data Sensitivity

Remove or anonymize personally identifiable or sensitive fields before publishing the notebook or results.
